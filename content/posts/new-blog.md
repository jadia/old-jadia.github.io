After switching between platforms like Tumblr, blogger and Github pages, I've stopped with Hugo hosted on Netlify. This blog is a revamped version of my old blog hosted on Github pages using Jekyll, which did not even give mobile support.  

I like to keep notes of things I learn and share them among friends. This blog will help me retain the information and might help some lost developer.

A post on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) motivated me to create this blog.
